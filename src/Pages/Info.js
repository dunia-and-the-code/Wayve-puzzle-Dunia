                    <p className='info-text'>Weâ€™re building artificial intelligence capable of complex driving using end-to-end deep learning; one which can scale across diverse urban environments. Wayve is building a full driving software system which is data-driven at every layer, learning to drive. Our unique end-to-end machine learning approach learns to drive in complex, never-seen-before urban environments. We learn to drive with computer vision by both observing human driving, and by using reinforcement learning.
                   We make no compromises which could limit the ability of our system to tackle new environments: our driving intelligence is built to suit autonomous mobility at scale, moving people, goods, and more. We aim to be the first to deploy our technology in a hundred cities, not just the first to a single city.</p>
